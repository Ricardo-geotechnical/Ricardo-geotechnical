ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I am a Geotechnical Engineer with experience in numerical modeling and reliability analysis. My goal is to integrate uncertainty quantification into geotechnical analysis to improve risk assessment in engineering projects.

Topics:

ðŸ”¹ Flow & Transport Modeling â€“ Simulating fluid flow through porous media under saturated and unsaturated conditions.

ðŸ”¹ Reliability & Bayesian Analysis â€“ Probabilistic approaches to geotechnical parameters and performance evaluation.


Current Projects

ðŸš§ 1D Monte Carlo Flow Simulation â€“ Estimating permeability uncertainties and flow distribution in saturated media.

Iâ€™m open to discussions, collaborations, and ideas! If youâ€™re working on similar topics or have insights on geotechnical uncertainty modeling, feel free to reach out.
