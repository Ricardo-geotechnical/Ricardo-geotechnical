ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I am a Geotechnical Engineer with experience in numerical modeling and currently expanding my expertise in probabilistic methods and uncertainty quantification. My goal is to integrate stochastic analysis into geotechnical engineering to enhance risk assessment and decision-making under uncertainty.

Topics of Interest

ðŸ”¹ Flow & Transport Modeling â€“ Simulating fluid flow in porous media under both saturated and unsaturated conditions.

ðŸ”¹ Probabilistic & Bayesian Analysis â€“ Using stochastic models to characterize geotechnical parameters and update predictions with new data.

Current Projects

ðŸš§ 1D Monte Carlo Flow Simulation â€“ Quantifying the impact of permeability variability on flow distribution in saturated media using probabilistic methods.

I'm always open to discussions, suggestions, and new ideas! If you work on geotechnical uncertainty modeling, probabilistic methods, or related topics, feel free to reach out.
